# NYT-Search
This was an in-class activity where several class mates worked together to re-create a website that searches the New York Times API based on user given criteria. We were given two hours in class to finish this exercise. For this version, our group finished most of the HTML structure and managed to call headlines to the webpage before we ran out of time. <br> <br>
<b>For transparency:</b>
Solution code was provided after class. The solution code was provided by Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. This activity was completed using the solution code and the repo is provided for reference.
